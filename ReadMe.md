# Ideas and Code Bases

This GitHub Repository features my R&D codes & notes. These are not neccisarily projects, their just codebases which I have created trying out new software packages and languages.

## Code Bases

##### Python

**Fundamentals** /python/fundamentals/

These are series of notebooks of a codemy.com course on python. It covers the basic fundamentals of the language.

**Packages** /python/packages/

These are a series of folders which contain my research on specific python packages, this mainly consits of me trying out the basic functionality of different python packages.

##### Frontend

**Fundamentals** /frontend/html/

html.html is a html document where i will try to add every mainstream html tag, and try to explain what the `<tag>` is trying to indicate.

## Ideas for Research Projects

##### Packages

* TensorFlow Probability Package | https://www.tensorflow.org/probability
* LangChain | https://docs.langchain.com/docs/

##### Frontend

* HTML best practices
* Onpage SEO good & bad comparison; pick a relatively niche, but fairly searched term, which is not dominated by a Legacy Internet Company. Compare the SEO from a highly ranked website and a low ranked website, from page one. on Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo.
